# Employee-CMS
Creates a database for managing employee information.

## Description

I built this project in order to practice using MySQL databases and queries to view, add, and edit information. It solves the problem of having to remember specific information for individual employees, as all of the departments, roles, and employees can be viewed by querying the database. I learned about MySQL queries, promise-chaining, joining tables, prepared statements, and using foreign keys to reference data from different tables.
